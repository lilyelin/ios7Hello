Simple app which given a $name will display Hello $name!, otherwise Hello World!

Created in order to learn ios7 in under 24 hours.

Notes so far on iOS7 development setup for beginners:
- upgrading from OS 10.6.8 Snow Leopard to OS Mountain Lion took ~ 1.5 hour not including download of OSX 10.8
- installing XCode 5 took ~ 30 minutes
- still uncertain as to why attempt to install/open XCode 4 caused the program to get stuck on "Not Responding"
